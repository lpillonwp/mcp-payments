# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue with sensitive details.

Preferred: use **GitHub Security Advisories** (private report), if enabled for the repository.
If that is not available, open an issue with a minimal description and ask maintainers for a private channel.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version on the default branch is supported.
